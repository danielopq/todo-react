## Overview

Responsive task manager application built with React. The app features two visually distinct themes, dark mode and light mode, allowing users to customize their workspace to match their preferences.The theme adapts to provide comfortable usability.

Users can easily create new tasks, update their status, and delete them when no longer needed. A filter menu offers additional flexibility, letting users display either all tasks, only completed tasks, or just active ones.

To ensure data persistence, all changes to the task list are automatically saved in the browser’s local storage. This means that even if the app is refreshed or reopened later, the task list remains intact and ready to pick up where you left off.

One of the app’s standout features is its drag-and-drop functionality, which allows users to reorganize tasks effortlessly. This makes prioritizing tasks intuitive and satisfying, providing a sense of control over the task order without unnecessary clicks or menus.

Additionally, the app has been carefully designed to be responsive, ensuring it works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Whether you're managing tasks on a computer or updating your list on the go, the app adjusts to provide a smooth and consistent experience across all screen sizes.

This project serves as a practical tool for staying organized but also as a showcase of React's capabilities, including state management, dynamic theming, responsiveness, and interactive features.

## My process

The website was initially designed and developed for the mobile experience. After completing the mobile version and ensuring all elements met the design specifications and functional requirements, I proceeded to create a desktop-friendly version. This adaptation was achieved solely through the use of CSS media queries, allowing the site to maintain its visual coherence and usability across a range of screen sizes.

The desktop adaptation involved restructuring and resizing specific components to enhance readability and ease of navigation on bigger screens. This approach allowed for a seamless transition from mobile to desktop without sacrificing performance or design integrity, resulting in a fully responsive website that provides an optimized user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
